                    Fibres are used in multiple industries to manufacture a number of different products. 
                    The primary resources for the FP&M sector are fibres, skins & forestry. 
                    These resources are processed to form the secondary resource that is used to manufacture 
                    the various products listed above. The primary resources are manufactured from natural 
                    fibres (cotton, wool, etc), forestry (woodlands, natural forest, plantation, forest, 
                    nurseries and man-made fibres (produced from chemicals extracted from oil, coal or trees). 
                    Many of these processes involve ancient techniques and skills that are thousands of years old. 
                    The technology within this industry is advancing rapidly, introducing new innovations in 
                    the manufacturing of fibres.
